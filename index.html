        <h2>Brief History</h2>
        <ul>
        <p>I was raised in California and graduated from Santa Monica High School in 2005. After high school I moved to Phoenix Arizona and became a Mechanic for Volkswagen, Audi, and Porsche. At some point I realized I no longer enjoyed working on cars so I joined the Marine Corps in 2010. While living in various places around the world and ending up away from California I decided I wanted to stay in the US permanentely and get an education, so once my contract with Marines was over I joined the National Guard on a three year contract. While part of the California National Guard I responded to wildfires which were destorying California homes. Now while fighting fires was honorable it was still taking time away from me getting my education. When I started having free time for college I had found out that the unit I was with was ready to send me to Cuba to be stationed at Guantanmo Bay for 6 months. Knowing that this would delay my schooling, I decided to move to Florida where my girlfriend at the time was living. I was now part of the Florida National Guard and was activated twice to respond to various hurricanes, which again was honorable but took time away from my education. On the last year of my contract I learned that the Florida National Guard wanted to send me to Afghanistan for 6 to 9 months. At that point I decided not to renew my contract but I did decide to marry my girlfriend, and now wife, Natalia. I seperated from the military in 2020 and am  currently working only on my bachelors degree in computer engineering. </p>
