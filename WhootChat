Current FAU students are given a number of promising tools to help them achieve their educational goals. FAU provides tutors, TA’s, help from the professor, and many other resources. If the school cannot accommodate every student's needs, there are third party options for help such as Khan academy, Chegg, etc. However, some of these options are one dimensional and only offer one form of help. 
WhootChat is a website being developed as a way to help current and future FAU students trying to achieve higher education and certification. It will accommodate every students ever changing schedule, provide a social place where files, social tutoring, and knowledge can be shared. WhootChat will allow students to explore all aspects of the classes they will need to take in order to achieve the major they are seeking.
Since all students lead different lives and cannot use all the resources that FAU provides, WhootChat is here to help. The idea of WhootChat is to give current and future students a better understanding of the material and majors they are pursuing. WhootChat will do this by having two different features to the website. 
The first feature will be a mapped major feature. Users will be able to select the major they wish to pursue and see all the past workloads for those majors. They will be able to review the ability of the professors and TA’s to decide the best way the user can learn and if the professor is right for them. 
The second feature will be a social chat session. You will be able to register and socialize with students from your current and past classes. Past students will voluntarily assist in any problems in the classes that students cannot solve with the resources available. 
The most important thing WhootChat can do is help students achieve their educational goals. We believe that WhootChat can offer an excellent, safe, and educational learning environment while giving the students answers to any questions they may have.
